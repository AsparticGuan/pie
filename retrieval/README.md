# Dynamic Retrieval

A notebook that can be used to prepare the retrieval dataset is `retrieval.ipynb`. Given a training dataset and the test set examples to optimize, it will retrieve the K most similar training examples pairs for the given test set examples. The retrieved pairs are then used to prompt the model for optimized outputs.
