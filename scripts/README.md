The file `sample_and_eval.py` contains an example of how to chain together sampling from a huggingface model and then use those generations for evaluation. It takes in a yaml file in the form like `template_config.yaml`. We caution the use of this as during our work, we ran all parts separately, and this example is mainly for illustrative purposes. It is possible the code has errors, because we did not run it in this form.
