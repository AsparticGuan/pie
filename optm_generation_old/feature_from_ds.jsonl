Mixing C++ and C I/O can cause synchronization issues and overhead.\n   - The program reads a string of maximum length 4009 (with `s+1` indexing) but uses `cin` for `n` and `scanf` for the string.\n\n2. **Preprocessor Macros and Includes**:\n   - Includes `bits/stdc++.h` which includes all standard headers, increasing compilation time and binary size.\n   - Defines macros for loops (`rep`, `per`) which might not be optimized by the compiler.\n\n3. **Data Types**:\n   - Uses `long long` for variables `n, ans, r, g, b` even though `n` is at most 4000 (so `int` would suffice for `n`, `r`, `g`, `b`). Using `long long` unnecessarily can lead to slower arithmetic operations.\n\n4. **String Storage**:\n   - Uses a fixed-size character array `s[4010]` which is efficient, but indexing starts at 1 (so `s[0]` is unused). This might cause cache inefficiencies.\n\n5. **Counting Characters**:\n   - The first loop counts the number of 'R', 'G', and 'B' characters. This is efficient.\n\n6. **Triplet Counting**:\n   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `r*g*b`, which is the total number of all possible triplets of distinct colors (without considering order).\n   - Then, it subtracts triplets that form an arithmetic progression (i.e., indices `(j, j+len, j+2*len)`) where all three characters are distinct. This is correct but inefficient.\n\n7. **Nested Loops for Arithmetic Progressions**:\n   - The nested loops iterate over `len` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `n-2*len`. The inner loop condition is correct but the range for `len` can be optimized: `len` only needs to go up to `n/2` (since `2*len <= n`).\n   - The inner loop checks for triplets `(j, j+len, j+2*len)` and if all three characters are distinct, it decrements `ans`. This requires three comparisons per triplet.\n\n8. **Inefficient Inner Loop**:\n   - The inner loop has a time complexity of O(n^2) which is acceptable for n=4000? Actually, worst-case n=4000: the inner loop runs about sum_{len=1}^{n} (n - 2*len) ≈ O(n^2) which is 16e6 operations. This is acceptable in C++ if optimized, but the inner condition might be simplified.\n\n9. **Redundant Comparisons**:\n   - The condition `s[j]!=s[j+len] && s[j]!=s[j+2*len] && s[j+len]!=s[j+2*len]` checks for distinctness. However, if we know the triplet is distinct, we can avoid these checks by precomputing the counts.\n\n10. **Potential for Precomputation**:\n    - Instead of iterating over all triplets, we could precompute the positions of each color and use a different approach to count invalid triplets.\n\n## Extracted Features in JSON:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"Unoptimized Code Conditions\": [\n      \"Uses `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` which includes all standard headers, increasing compilation time and binary size.\",\n      \"Uses preprocessor macros for loops (`rep`, `per`) which might not be optimized by the compiler.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"Unoptimized Code Conditions\": [\n      \"Mixes C++ (`cin`) and C (`scanf`, `printf`) I/O functions, which can cause synchronization overhead.\",\n      \"Uses `printf` for output without ensuring proper synchronization with `cout`.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"Unoptimized Code Conditions\": [\n      \"Uses `long long` for variables `n`, `r`, `g`, `b` even though `n` is at most 4000 (so `int` would suffice).
